# CardProblem - Genetic Algorithm

This program was build as part of CS Artificial Intelligence course.  
The purpose of this this algorithm is to solve the Card Problem:  
You have to split 10 cards with values 1-10 to 2 even piles  
while 1 pile have a sum of 36 and the other have a product of 360  

## Highlights:
- C#
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
